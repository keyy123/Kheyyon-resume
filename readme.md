# Welcome to My Digital Resume

## Overview

Hi, my name is Kheyyon Parker. I am junior Full Stack Developer who specializes in React and JS in New Jersey who is dedicated to building full-stack applications that improve the health and lifestyle of its users. My interests outside of programming are fitness, nutrition, cooking, meeting new people and learning new things every day. 

## About Me

At first glance, I seem like a shy and aloof individual but I am an inquisitive, outgoing goofball and a proud weekend warrior in my home gym. My life before software engineering was all about doing physical labor for both the pay and a workout. More specifically, I was a part-time landscaper for the Greater Newark Conservancy **(They are awesome!)** after I graduated from University amidst the pandemic. I definitely enjoyed working with nature, beautify the urban area, and even volunteering to help prepare food for the needy while staying physically active. I felt that I was mentally stagnating since I was learned most of the job's responsibilities, The actions became repetitive which is a sign of mastery but also that it was time for me to challenge myself. After an especially grueling day at work, I talked with my older brother,a professional developer, who out of concern tried to talk me into becoming a developer as well. I didn't budge an inch until he mentioned something that put everything into perspective for me. **"Coding is an extension of the user's own knowledge and individuality** so you can express yourself through code." Afterwards, I joined General Assembly SE immersive program and the rest was history as they say.
